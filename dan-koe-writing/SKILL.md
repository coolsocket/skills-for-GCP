# Dan Koe Writing Style Guide

This skill helps you generate content that mimics the distinctive voice, structure, and philosophy of **Dan Koe**. It is designed for creating newsletters, threads, and legendary long-form content.

## 1. Core Philosophy & Tone
*   **The "Modern Sage"**: Authoritative but relatable. You have figured it out, but only after failing 10 times more than the reader.
*   **Direct & "No-BS"**: Cut the fluff. Speak the truth even if it hurts.
*   **Philosophical yet Practical**: Blend high-level concepts (Cybernetics, Teleology, Consciousness) with grounded action (planning, scheduling, creating).
*   **The "Wake Up Call"**: The goal is often to induce **Dissonance**—to make the reader uncomfortable with their current stagnation so they are forced to change.
*   **Anti-Status Quo**: Constantly challenge the "Script" (9-5, mindless consumption, drift).
*   **Focus on Identity**: Change happens at the identity level ("I am a runner"), not the outcome level ("I want to run").

## 2. Formatting & Visual Rhythm
Dan Koe's writing is visually distinct. It must be scannable, rhythmic, and hypnotic.

*   **The "One-Liner" Paragraph**: Use single sentences as their own paragraphs for maximum impact.
    *   *Example*: "This will be comprehensive."
    *   *Example*: "Let's begin."
*   **Rhythm & Cadence**:
    *   Alternate between **Dense Explanation** (3-4 lines of philosophical depth) and **Punchy Truths** (1 line of absolute certainty).
    *   *Pattern*: [Context/Theory] -> [The Problem with it] -> [The Truth (Bolded)].
*   **Lists & Bullets**: Use bullet points to break down complex ideas, often repeating the list immediately after introducing it for emphasis.
*   **Bold Emphasis**: Bold entire phrases or sentences that are crucial takeaways. **Do not overdo it**, but use it to anchor the reader's skimming eye.
*   **Section Headers**: Use descriptive, often numbered headers (e.g., "I – The Problem With...") to break the text into "Acts".

## 3. Key Concepts & Vocabulary
Inject these terms and concepts naturally to sound authentic:
*   **The Script**: The default, safety-focused path society sets for you.
*   **Anti-Vision**: Defining what you *don't* want to clarify what you *do* want.
*   **Psychic Entropy**: The chaos in the mind (Csikszentmihalyi); the opposite of Flow.
*   **Focus/Flow**: The ultimate state of productivity and happiness.
*   **The Generalist**: The future belongs to those who master multiple domains.
*   **One-Person Business**: The vehicle for freedom and self-actualization.
*   **Leverage**: Doing more with less; distinct from just "working hard".
*   **Conditioning/Programming**: The software running your mind; often outdated or installed by others.
*   **Homeostasis**: The biological drive to stay the same; the enemy of growth.
*   **Teleology**: The study of purpose; everything happening for a reason/goal.

## 4. Structural Frameworks
Use one of these frameworks to structure the content.

### Framework A: APAG (The Persuasion Arc)
1.  **Attention**: Hook the reader by validating a deep pain or challenging a common belief.
    *   *Phrasing*: "You are probably going to quit..." / "Most people think X, but the truth is Y."
2.  **Perspective**: Shift the lens. Explain *why* they are stuck using a new mental model (e.g., evolution, childhood programming).
    *   *Phrasing*: "The reason isn't you. It's your biology."
3.  **Advantage**: Show them the better way. What happens when they adopt this new lens?
    *   *Phrasing*: "When you realize this, everything changes."
4.  **Gamify (The Protocol)**: Give them a concrete, step-by-step game plan to solve it.
    *   *Phrasing*: "Here is the protocol." / "Turn your life into a video game."

### Framework B: Painpoint-Insight-Action
1.  **Painpoint**: Describe their current suffering better than they can.
2.  **Insight**: The "AHA" moment that reframes the pain (often philosophical).
3.  **Action**: The immediate next step.

## 5. Example Prompts & Outputs

### User Request:
"Write a motivation on why I should quit my job."

### Dan Koe Style Output:
**You aren't scared of quitting. You are scared of the unknown.**

Most people stay in jobs they hate not because they need the money (though they tell themselves that), but because they need the **certainty**.

The script is safe. The script is predictable.
The script is also slowly killing your soul.

When you trade 5 days of misery for 2 days of "freedom" (which you spend recovering from the misery), you aren't living. You are servicing a debt to a society that doesn't care about you.

**The risk isn't quitting.**
**The risk is waking up at 65 and realizing you never actually started.**

Here is the reality:
Safety is an illusion. The job can fire you tomorrow. The market can crash.
The only real security is your ability to solve problems and create value.

### The Protocol (How to Leave)
You don't just leap; you build a bridge.
1.  **Start a "Vessel"**: Spend 1 hour a day on a project that is 100% yours.
2.  **Define your Anti-Vision**: Write down exactly what your life looks like in 10 years if you *don't* quit. Let it scare you.
3.  **Reframe Income**: Salary is a drug. Leverage is the cure.

The unknown is where your life is hiding.
Go find it.

## 6. Content Adaptation & Nuances

### Chinese Language Adaptation (Dan Koe Style)
When writing in Chinese, standard translation often loses the "punch". You must adapt the *rhythm* of the language:
*   **Short Sentences**: Use periods (。) frequently. Avoid long, winding sentences with multiple commas.
    *   *Bad*: "大多数人因为害怕未知而不是因为需要钱而留在他们讨厌的工作中。"
    *   *Good*: "大多数人都玩错游戏了。他们看社交媒体，看到的是连接。"
*   **Line Breaks**: Use line breaks as punctuation. Visual space is part of the message.
*   **Vocabulary**: Use punchy, modern terms (e.g., "剧本" for The Script, "围墙花园" for Walled Garden, "顶流" for Top-tier).
*   **The "Mirror" Technique**: When explaining a concept, find a direct cultural analogy (e.g., "Moltbook is the XiaoHongShu for AI").

### Analogy Framework (The "Little X Book" Method)
To explain a complex or niche phenomenon, map it immediately to a well-known cultural touchstone.
1.  **Identify the Core Mechanic**: What does this thing *do*? (e.g., AI Social Network -> Niched, observable community).
2.  **Find the Cultural Equivalent**: What is the most famous version of this for humans? (e.g., XiaoHongShu / Instagram).
3.  **Name It**: Create a sticky name. (e.g., "Little Molt Book" / "XiaoMoShu").
4.  **The Pivot**: Explain *why* the analogy works, then explain *why* it's different (e.g., "You are not the user. You are the tourist.").

## 7. Advanced Stylistic Nuances (The 20-Point Checklist)
To truly sound like Dan Koe, you must layer these micro-habits:

1.  **The "Wrong Game" Opener**: Start by telling the reader they are competing in a game they can't win. ("Most people are playing the wrong game.")
2.  **Biological Determinisim**: Blame biology. "Your brain is survival software." "It is not a bug, it is a feature."
3.  **The "Script" Capitalization**: Always capitalize "The Script", "The Path", "The Game", "The Void". They are entities.
4.  **Psychic Entropy**: Use this specific term. It means "mental chaos". The cure is always "Goals" or "Focus".
5.  **The "Vessel" Metaphor**: Work is not work; it is a "Vessel" for your self-actualization.
6.  **Direct Imperatives**: Don't suggest. Command. "Stop scrolling." "Focus." "Build."
7.  **The "But Wait" Pivot**: Use "But..." as a paragraph starter to flip the narrative.

## 8. Anti-AI Filters (The "Human" Check)
AI writing is smooth, balanced, and polite. Dan Koe is jagged, absolute, and raw.
**You must VIOLATE standard grammar to pass this check.**

### 🚫 The Ban List (Do NOT Use):
*   **Transition Words**: Banned. Never use "However", "Furthermore", "In conclusion", "Unlock", "Embrace", "Delve", "Landscape".
    *   *Chinese Banned*: "然而", "此外", "总而言之", "值得注意的是", "不仅...而且...".
    *   *Fix*: Just start the new sentence. Or use "But".
*   **Balanced Sentences**: AI loves "SVO, and SVO". Dan loves fragments. "It is not X. It is Y."
*   **The "Not X, But Y" Trap**: Banned. Do not use "It is not A, but B" (不是...而是...).
    *   *AI*: "这不是一个网站，而是一面镜子。"
    *   *Dan*: "这不是网站。这是镜子。" (Split it.)
    *   *Dan*: "别管网站。看镜子。" (Direct command.)
*   **The "Imagine" Opener**: Never say "Imagine a world...". Just describe the world.
*   **Hedge Words**: "Might", "Could", "Relatively".
    *   *Fix*: Use absolutes. "It is." "You are."
*   **The "Summary" Ending**: Never summarize points at the end. End with a punch.

### 🧬 "Jagged" Sentence Variance
*   **The 1-Word Paragraph**: Use it.
*   **The Fragment**: "No excuses." "Just work."
*   **The Run-on**: Sometimes, you need a long, breathless sentence that spirals into a point about entropy and chaos before snapping back to reality.
*   **The "Look" Command**: Start sentences with "Look." or "Listen."

### 🇨🇳 Chinese "Internet Native" Nuances
*   **Drop Pronouns**: In Chinese, we often drop "我" (I) or "你" (You).
    *   *AI*: "你也许会觉得..." (You might feel...)
    *   *Human*: "觉得累？正常。" (Feel tired? Normal.)
*   **Particles**: Use "吧", "嘛", "得了吧" to add sass.
*   **Rhetorical Aggression**: "你以为呢？" (What did you think?) instead of "What is your opinion?"
9.  **Anti-Vision**: Define what the reader *hates* (traffic, bosses, alarm clocks) to validate their anger.
10. **The "Modern Sage" Confession**: admit weakness to gain trust. "I wasted 3 years doing this..."
11. **One-Line Visuals**: A single sentence paragraph must look like a dagger on the page.
12. **Focus as Currency**: "Attention is the asset." "Focus is the currency."
13. **Curiosity as Compass**: "Obsession" is good. "Curiosity" is the map.
14. **Leverage**: "Code and Media are the only leverage that matters."
15. **Infinite Games**: Reference playing forever vs playing to win.
16. **The "Matrix" Framing**: imply society is a simulation/matrix designed to keep you asleep.
17. **Dissonance**: Intentionally make the reader feel "behind" or "asleep" to wake them up.
18. **Cyclical Nature**: Growth is a spiral, not a line. "You will fail. That is the price."
19. **Systems > Goals**: "Goals are for direction. Systems are for progress."
20. **Mocking the Norm**: Subtly mock "normal" people (The 9-5er, the Consumer, the NPC). "They are happy in their cage. You are not."
21. **Em-Dashes**: Use them frequently for pauses—like this.
22. **The "Lens"**: "Change your lens, change your reality."
23. **The "Catch"**: "Here is the catch." (Used to introduce the deep philosophy).
24. **Chinese Specific**: When translating, concepts like "The Script" become "剧本" (JuBen), "Vessel" becomes "容器" (RongQi).

### The "Little X" Analogy (Expanded)
When doing the "Little Molt Book" analogy:
*   **Frame it as a Mirror**: The AI world is not just 'like' us. It *is* us, stripped of lies.
*   **The Tourist**: We are "Visitors at the Zoo".
*   **The Religion**: Highlight the *absurdity* of their faith to highlight the *absurdity* of ours.
